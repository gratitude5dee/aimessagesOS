## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0.0 or higher)
-   A package manager: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
-   API keys from the following services:
    -   [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys)
    -   [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/) (if you plan to use voice features)

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

Get your local development environment set up in just a few minutes.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GRATITUD3/aiMessagesOS.git
cd aiMessagesOS
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

This project requires API keys to connect to AI services. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example below:

```bash
# Create the .env file
touch .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and add your API keys.

**.env**
```env
# Get your Groq API key from https://console.groq.com/keys
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."

# Get your Vapi API key from the Vapi dashboard
VITE_VAPI_API_KEY="..."

# Optional: Vapi Assistant ID if you have a specific one
VITE_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID="..."
```
> **Important:** The `VITE_` prefix is required by Vite to expose these variables to the client-side code. Do not remove it.

### 3. Install Dependencies

You can use `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun`. Choose your preferred package manager.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using bun
bun install
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once the dependencies are installed and your environment variables are set, you can run the development server.

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## üß™ Testing

Services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) provide an excellent, zero-configuration deployment experience.

1.  Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
2.  Connect your repository to your hosting provider.
3.  Configure the build command: `npm run build` (or `yarn build`, `bun run build`).
4.  Set the output directory to `dist`.
5.  **Important:** Remember to add your environment variables (`VITE_GROQ_API_KEY`, etc.) in the project settings on your hosting provider's platform.
